Hi,

My name is **Vicent Soria** and, although I was born in Valencia, I have been living in Barcelona for a quite few years.

I have more than 10 years of experience both in **systems administration** and **software development**. I have also worked in more management/responsibility positions, mainly as **CTO**.

Over the years, I have been interested in both development and system administration topics, and currently, I have a **hybrid profile** that allows me to **develop** (and **manage**) **software projects from scratch** (and **operations**).   

I consider myself a fervent defender of **DevOps** culture, **Agile** project management, and particularly, **Kaizen (改善) / continuous improvement**.

In my many years of experience, I have worked on many projects (of different complexity and size) and in several teams (of different levels of expertise).

Here is a list of technologies that I am comfortable with (in no particular order):

#### Programming Languages
- Python
- Go
- PHP

#### CI/CD
- Jenkins
- Travis
- Spinnaker

#### Databases
- Redis
- MySQL/MariaDB

#### Infrastructure
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Ansible
- Terraform
- Cloudformation
- Packer
- Docker

#### Monitorization
- Datadog
- New Relic

#### Others
- Symfony
- Git
